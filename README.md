Disaster Management System: Arduino's watchful eyes on disasters, instant response

Project Overview:

The Arduino Disaster Management System 2023 is a cutting-edge implementation designed to issue instant messages to local residents in the event of disasters. Utilizing various sensors, including the MPU6050 accelerometer for earthquake detection, MQ2 gas sensor for detecting gases, and MH Flame sensor for fire detection, this system aims to provide swift and effective communication during critical situations. The GSM Sim Module is integrated to send instant messages to residents, ensuring a rapid response to potential threats.

System Features:

Earthquake Detection: The MPU6050 accelerometer is employed to detect seismic activity and trigger instant alerts.  
Gas Threat Detection: The MQ2 gas sensor identifies various gases such as LNG, butane, propane, methane, alcohol, and hydrogen.  
Fire Detection: The MH Flame sensor is utilized to detect the presence of fire and initiate immediate communication.  
Instant Messaging: The integrated GSM Sim Module enables the system to send instant messages to local residents, providing timely information and guidance.  

Installation Instructions:

-> Connect the MPU6050 accelerometer for earthquake detection.  
-> Attach the MQ2 gas sensor to identify potential gas leaks.  
-> Install the MH Flame sensor for fire detection.  
-> Integrate the GSM Sim Module to enable instant messaging capabilities.  
-> Power the Arduino Disaster Management System and ensure all connections are secure.  


Usage:  
  
-> Power on the system and ensure all sensors are operational.  
-> The system will continuously monitor for earthquakes, gas threats, and fires.  
-> In the event of a detected disaster, instant messages will be sent via the GSM Sim Module to local residents.  
-> Regularly check the system for sensor functionality and conduct maintenance as needed.  



Disclaimer:  
  
This system is designed to enhance disaster management efforts but should not be solely relied upon for critical decisions. It is essential to follow official guidelines and instructions provided by local authorities during emergency situations.
